# Code Refactor Starter Code
Code Refactor
    In this activity most of the code had to remain with the same concept. A few changes needed to happen to make the page more effective. 


    Some of the changes incorporated were: 

    The HTML code needed a few debugging with the hyperlinks being able to open properly.

    A meta needed to be added to adjust the viewpoint of the page. 

    CSS code: Needed to add a variable function in order to become more efficient when new changes need to be made.
